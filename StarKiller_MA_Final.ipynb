            "This guide provides a systematic, multi-layered methodology for diagnosing and resolving Ethernet connectivity problems. The process begins with the most common and simplest issues at the Physical Layer (cables, lights) and progressively moves up the stack to the Operating System (drivers, interface status), Network Configuration (IP addressing, DNS), and finally, external connectivity. This structured approach efficiently isolates the root cause, whether it's a hardware fault, a driver issue, a misconfiguration, or an external network problem. Commands are provided for both Linux and Windows environments.\n",

            "    *   **Link/Activity Light:** Usually green. A solid light indicates a successful physical link. A blinking light indicates data is being transferred. No light means no physical link is established.\n",
            "    *   **Speed Light:** Often amber/orange or multi-colored. Indicates the link speed (e.g., 100 Mbps vs. 1 Gbps).\n",
            "    *   **Conclusion:** If you have **no lights**, the problem is almost certainly physical. Try a different, known-good Ethernet cable and a different port on your router or switch.\n",

Unauthorized personnel could connect a device to gain network access. Use port security features on managed switches (`switchport port-security`) to restrict access to known MAC addresses.\n",
            "*   **Administrative Privileges:** Many of the diagnostic commands (`ethtool`, restarting services) require `sudo` or Administrator access. Be certain you are running commands from a trusted source. Do not execute scripts or commands from untrusted websites.\n",
            "*   **Firewall Configuration:** A common, but risky, troubleshooting step is to temporarily disable the host firewall (`ufw` on Linux, Windows Defender Firewall on Windows) to rule it out as the cause. **This should only be a temporary measure.** If disabling the firewall resolves the issue, the correct solution is to add a specific rule to allow the required traffic, not to leave the firewall off.\n",
            "*   **Information Disclosure:** The output from `ipconfig /all` or `traceroute` contains information about your internal network configuration (private IP addresses, gateway) and network topology. Be cautious about posting the full, unredacted output of these commands on public forums.\n",
